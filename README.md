## Importing into Netbeans
Clone the repository into a convenient place. Then, create a new netbeans project. In the popup window select 'Java Project with Existing Sources'.
Give the project an appropriate name and project folder. Don't store the netbeans project in the repository folder so it doesn't end up tracked.
Then click next and add folder by the 'source package folders' box. Select the repository directory. Click Finish.
