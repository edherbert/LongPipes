The user interface will need to contain a method that mirrors the contents of the current order.

I could have a method to update the user interface.
This will get the current order from the session and display it in the buttons.

The user interface will contain a method to set the current order of the session.
If there are no orders then the user interface will be blanked.

When the user changes values in the ui, the ui will directly access the objects to change their values.

Jobs left to do:
    I'll do the ui integration.
    Creation of test cases (essentually just a class to test and demonstrate how it works).
    Someone to do the writeup
    Finishing the use case diagram.
